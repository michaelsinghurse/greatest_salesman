      <h2>The Scroll Marked I</h2>
      <h3>Today I begin a new life</h3>
      <p>Today I begin a new life.</p>

      <p>Today I shed my old skin, which hath, too long, suffered the bruises 
      of failure and the wounds of mediocrity.</p>

      <p>Today I am born anew and my birthplace is a vineyard where there is 
      fruit for all.</p>

      <p>Today I will pluck grapes of wisdom from the tallest and fullest vines 
      in the vineyard, for these were planted by the wisest of my profession who 
      have come before me, generation upon generation.</p>

      <p>Today I will savor the taste of grapes from these vines and verily I 
      will swallow the seed of success buried in each and new life will sprout 
      within me.</p>
      
      <p>The career I have chosen is laden with opportunity yet it is fraught 
      with heartbreak and despair and the bodies of those who have failed, were 
      they piled one atop another, would cast its shadow down upon all the 
      pyramids of the earth.</p>

      <p>Yet I will not fail, as the others, for in my hands I now hold the 
      charts, which will guide me through perilous waters to shores, which only 
      yesterday seemed but a dream.</p>

      <p>Failure will no longer by my payment for my struggle. Just as nature
      made no provision for my body to tolerate pain neither has it made any
      provision for my life to suffer failure. Failure, like pain, is alien to
      my life. In the past I accepted it as I accepted pain. Now I reject it and
      I am prepared for wisdom and principles which will guide me out of the
      shadows into the sunlight of wealth, position, and happiness far beyond my
      most extravagant dreams until even the golden apples in the Garden of
      Hesperides will seem no more than my just reward.</p>  

      <p>Time teaches 
      all things to he who lives forever but I have not the luxury of eternity.  
      Yet, within my allotted time I must practice the art of patience for nature
      acts never in haste. To create the olive, king of all trees, a hundred
      years is required. An onion plant is old in nine weeks. I have lived as an
      onion plant. It has not pleased me. Now I wouldst become the greatest of
      olive trees and, in truth, the greatest of salesmen.</p>

      <p>And how will this be
      accomplished? For I have neither the knowledge nor the experience to
      achieve greatness and already I have stumbled in ignorance and fallen into
      pools of self-pity. The answer is simple. I will commence my journey
      unencumbered with either the weight of unnecessary knowledge or the
      handicap of meaningless experience. Nature already has supplied me with
      knowledge and instinct far greater than any beast in the forest and the
      value of experience is overrated, usually by old men who nod wisely and
      speak stupidly.</p>  

      <p>In truth, experience teaches thoroughly yet her course of
      instruction devours men’s years so the value of her lessons diminishes
      with the time necessary to acquire her special wisdom.  The end finds it
      wasted on dead men. Furthermore, experience is comparable to fashion; an
      action that proved successful today will be unworkable and impractical
      tomorrow.</p>

      <p>Only principles endure and these I now possess, for the laws
      that will lead me to greatness are contained in the words of these
      scrolls. What they will teach me is more to prevent failure than to gain
      success, for what is success other than a state of mind?  Which two, among
      a thousand wise men, will define success in the same words; yet failure is
      always described in one way. Failure is man’s inability to reach his goals
      in life, whatever they may be.</p>  

      <p>In truth, the only difference between
      those who have failed and those who have succeeded lies in the differences
      of their habits. Good habits are the key to all success. Bad habits are
      the unlocked door to failure. Thus, the first law I will obey, which
      precedeth all others is – I will form good habits and become their
      slave.</p>

      <p>As a child I was slave to my impulses; now I am slave to my habits, as are
      all grown men. I have surrendered my free will to the years of accumulated
      habits and the past deeds of my life have already marked out a path, which
      threatens to imprison my future. My actions are ruled by appetite,
      passion, prejudice, greed, love, fear, environment, habit, and the worst
      of these tyrants is habit.  Therefore, if I must be a slave to habit let
      me be a slave to good habits. My bad habits must be destroyed and new
      furrows prepared for good seed.</p>  

      <p>I will form good habits and become their slave.</p>  

      <p>And how will I accomplish this difficult feat? Through these
      scrolls, it will be done, for each scroll contains a principle which will
      drive a bad habit from my life and replace it with one which will bring me
      closer to success.  For it is another of nature’s laws that only a habit
      can subdue another habit. So, in order for these written words to perform
      their chosen task, I must discipline myself with the first of my new
      habits, which is as follows:</p>

      <p>I will read each scroll for thirty days in
      this prescribed manner, before I proceed to the next scroll.</p>  

      <p>First, I
      will read the words in silence when I arise. Then, I will read the words
      in silence after I have partaken of my midday meal.  Last, I will read the
      words again just before I retire at day’s end, and most important, on this
      occasion I will read the words aloud.</p>  

      <p>On the next day I will repeat this
      procedure, and I will continue in like manner for thirty days. Then, I
      will turn to the next scroll and repeat this procedure for another thirty
      days. I will continue in this manner until I have lived with each scroll
      for thirty days and my reading has become habit.</p>  

      <p>And what will be
      accomplished with this habit? Herein lies the hidden secret of all man’s
      accomplishments. As I repeat the words daily they will soon become a part
      of my active mind, but more important, they will also seep into my other
      mind, that mysterious source which never sleeps, which creates my dreams,
      and often makes me act in ways I do not comprehend.</p> 

      <p>As the words of these
      scrolls are consumed by my mysterious mind I will begin to awake, each
      morning, with a vitality I have never known before. My vigor will
      increase, my enthusiasm will rise, my desire to meet the world will
      overcome every fear I once knew at sunrise, and I will be happier than I
      ever believed it possible to be in this world of strife and sorrow.</p>

      <p>Eventually, I will find myself reacting to all situations which confront
      me as I was commanded in the scrolls to react, and soon these actions and
      reactions will become easy to perform, for any act with practice becomes
      easy.</p>

      <p>Thus a new and good habit is born, for when an act becomes easy
      through constant repetition it becomes a pleasure to perform and if it is
      a pleasure to perform it is man’s nature to perform it often. When I
      perform it often it becomes a habit and I become its slave and since it is
      a good habit this is my will.</p>  

      <p>Today I begin a new life.</p>  

      <p>And I make a
      solemn oath to myself that nothing will retard my new life’s growth. I
      will lose not a day from these readings for that day cannot be retrieved
      nor can I substitute another for it. I must not, I will not, break this
      habit of daily reading from these scrolls and, in truth, the few moments
      spent each day on this new habit are but a small price to pay for the
      happiness and success that will be mine.</p>  

      <p>As I read and re-read the words
      in these scrolls to follow, never will I allow the brevity of each scroll
      nor the simplicity of its words to cause me to treat the scroll’s message
      lightly. Thousands of grapes are pressed to fill one jar with wine, and
      the grapes skin and pulp are tossed to the birds. So it is with these
      grapes of wisdom from the ages. Much has been filtered and tossed to the
      wind. Only the pure truth lies distilled in the words to come. I will
      drink as instructed and spill not one drop. And the seed of success I will
      swallow.</p>  

      <p>Today my old skin has become as dust. I will walk tall among men
      and they will know me not, for today I am a new man, with a new life.</p>

      <h3>I will greet this day with love in my heart</h3>

      <p>I will greet this day with love in my heart.</p>  

      <p>For this is the greatest
      secret of success in all ventures. Muscle can split a shield and even
      destroy life but only the unseen power of love can open the hearts of men
      and until I master this art I will remain no more than a peddler in the
      market place. I will make love my greatest weapon and none on whom I call
      can defend against its force.</p>  

      <p>My reasoning they may counter; my speech
      they may distrust; my apparel they may disapprove; my face they may
      reject; and even my bargains may cause them suspicion; yet my love will
      melt all hearts liken to the sun whose rays soften the coldest clay.</p>  

      <p>I will greet this day with love in my heart.</p>  

      <p>And how will I do this?
      Henceforth will I look on all things with love and I will be born again. I
      will love the sun for it warms my bones; yet I will love the rain for it
      cleanses my spirit. I will love the light for it shows me the way; yet I
      will love the darkness for it shows me the stars. I will welcome happiness
      for it enlarges my heart; yet I will endure sadness for it opens my soul.
      I will acknowledge rewards for they are my due; yet I will welcome
      obstacles for they are my challenge.</p>  

      <p>I will greet this day with love in my heart.</p>  

      <p>And how will I speak? I will laud mine enemies and they will
      become friends; I will encourage my friends and they will become brothers.
      Always will I dig for reasons to applaud; never will I scratch for excuses
      to gossip. When I am tempted to criticize I will bite my tongue; when I am
      moved to praise I will shout from the roofs.</p>  

      <p>Is it not so that birds, the
      wind, the sea and all nature speaks with the music of praise for their
      creator? Cannot I speak with the same music to his children? Henceforth
      will I remember this secret and it will change my life.</p>  

      <p>I will greet this day with love in my heart.</p>  

      <p>And how will I act? I will love all manners of
      men for each has qualities to be admired even though they be hidden.  With
      love I will tear down the wall of suspicion and hate which they have built
      round their hearts and in its place will I build bridges so that my love
      may enter their souls.</p>  

      <p>I will love the ambitious for they can inspire me;
      I will love the failures for they can teach me. I will love the kings for
      they are but human; I will love the meek for they are divine. I will love
      the rich for they are yet lonely; I will love the poor for they are so
      many. I will love the young for the faith they hold; I will love the old
      for the wisdom they share. I will love the beautiful for their eyes of
      sadness; I will love the ugly for their souls of peace.</p>  

      <p>I will greet this day with love in my heart.</p>  

      <p>But how will I react to the actions of others?
      With love. For just as love is my weapon to open the hearts of men, love
      is also my shield to repulse the arrows of hate and the spears of anger.
      Adversity and discouragement will beat against my new shield and become as
      the softest of rains. My shield will protect me in the market place and
      sustain me when I am alone. It will uplift me in moments of despair yet it
      will calm me in time of exultation. It will become stronger and more
      protective with use until one day I will cast aside and walk unencumbered
      among all manners of men and, when I do, my name will be raised high on
      the pyramid of life.</p>  

      <p>I will greet this day with love in my heart.</p>  

      <p>And
      how will I confront each whom I meet? In only one way. In silence and to
      myself I will address him and say I Love You. Though spoken in silence
      these words will shine in my eyes, unwrinkle my brow, bring a smile to my
      lips, and echo in my voice; and his heart will be opened. And who is there
      who will say nay to my goods when his hearts feels my love?</p>  

      <p>I will greet this day with love in my heart.</p>  

      <p>And most of all I will love myself. For
      when I do I will zealously inspect all things which enter my body, my
      mind, my soul, and my heart. Never will I overindulge the requests of my
      flesh; rather I will cherish my body with cleanliness and moderation.
      Never will I allow my mind to be attracted to evil and despair, rather I
      will uplift it with the knowledge and wisdom of the ages. Never will I
      allow my soul to become complacent and satisfied, rather I will feed it
      with meditation and prayer. Never will I allow my heart to become small
      and bitter, rather I will share it and it will grow and warm the
      earth.</p>  

      <p>I will greet this day with love in my heart. Henceforth will I love all
      mankind. From this moment all hate is let from my veins for I have not
      time to hate, only time to love. From this moment I take the first step
      required to become a man among men.  With love I will increase my sales a
      hundred-fold and become a great salesman. If I have no other qualities I
      can succeed with love alone. Without it I will fail though I possess all
      the knowledge and skills of the world.</p>  

      <p>I will greet this day with love, and I will succeed.</p>

      <h2>The Scroll Marked III</h2> 
      <h3>I will persist until I succeed</h3> 

      <p>I will persist until I succeed.</p>  

      <p>In the Orient young bulls are tested for
      the fight arena in a certain manner. Each is brought to the ring and
      allowed to attack a picador who pricks them with a lance. The bravery of
      each bull is then rated with care according to the number of times he
      demonstrates his willingness to charge in spite of the sting of the blade.
      Henceforth will I recognize that each day I am tested by life in like
      manner. If I persist, if I continue to try, if I continue to charge
      forward, I will succeed.</p>  

      <p>I will persist until I succeed.</p>  

      <p>I was not
      delivered unto this world in defeat, nor does failure course in my veins.
      I am not a sheep waiting to be prodded by my shepherd. I am a lion and I
      refuse to talk, to walk, to sleep with the sheep. I will hear not those
      who weep and complain, for their disease is contagious. Let them join the
      sheep. The slaughterhouse of failure is not my destiny.</p>  

      <p>I will persist until I succeed.</p>  

      <p>The prizes of life are at the end of each journey, not
      near the beginning; and it is not given to me to know how many steps are
      necessary in order to reach my goal. Failure I may still encounter at the
      thousandth step, yet success hides behind the next bend in the road. Never
      will I know how close it lies unless I turn the corner.</p>  

      <p>Always will I
      take another step. If that is of no avail I will take another, and yet
      another. In truth, one step at a time is not too difficult.</p>  

      <p>I will persist until I succeed.</p>  

      <p>Henceforth, I will consider each day's effort as
      but one blow of my blade against a mighty oak. The first blow may cause
      not a tremor in the wood, nor the second, nor the third. Each blow, of
      itself, may be trifling, and seem of no consequence. Yet from childish
      swipes the oak will eventually tumble. So it will be with my efforts of
      today.  I will be liken to the rain drop which washes away the mountain;
      the ant who devours a tiger; the star which brightens the earth; the slave
      who builds a pyramid. I will build my castle one brick at a time for I
      know that small attempts, repeated, will complete any undertaking.</p>  

      <p>I will persist until I succeed.</p>  

      <p>I will never consider defeat and I will remove
      from my vocabulary such words and phrases as quit, cannot, unable,
      impossible, out of the question, improbable, failure, unworkable,
      hopeless, and retreat; for they are the words of fools.  I will avoid
      despair but if this disease of the mind should infect me then I will work
      on in despair.  I will toil and I will endure. I will ignore the obstacles
      at my feet and keep mine eyes on the goals above my head, for I know that
      where dry desert ends, green grass grows.</p>  

      <p>I will persist until I succeed.  

      <p>I will remember the ancient law of averages and I will bend it to my good.
      I will persist with knowledge that each failure to sell will increase my
      chance for success at the next attempt. Each nay I hear will bring me
      closer to the sound of yea. Each frown I meet only prepares me for the
      smile to come. Each misfortune I encounter will carry in it the seed of
      tomorrow's good luck. I must have the night to appreciate the day. I must
      fail often to succeed only once.</p>  

      <p>I will persist until I succeed.  

      <p>I will
      try, and try, and try again. Each obstacle I will consider as a mere
      detour to my goal and a challenge to my profession. I will persist and
      develop my skills as the mariner develops his, by learning to ride out the
      wrath of each storm.</p>  

      <p>I will persist until I succeed.</p>  

      <p>Henceforth, I will
      learn and apply another secret of those who excel in my work.  When each
      day is ended, not regarding whether it has been a success or a failure, I
      will attempt to achieve one more sale. When my thoughts beckon my tired
      body homeward I will resist the temptation to depart. I will try again. I
      will make one more attempt to close with victory, and if that fails I will
      make another. Never will I allow any day to end with a failure. Thus will
      I plant the seed of tomorrow's success and gain an insurmountable
      advantage over those who cease their labor at a prescribed time. When
      others cease their struggle, then mine will begin, and my harvest will be
      full.</p>  

      <p>I will persist until I succeed.<p>  

      <p>Nor will I allow yesterday's
      success to lull me into today's complacency, for this is the great
      foundation of failure. I will forget the happenings of the day that is
      gone, whether they were good or bad, and greet the new sun with confidence
      that this will be the best day of my life.</p>  

      <p>So long as there is breath in
      me, that long will I persist. For now I know one of the greatest
      principles of success; if I persist long enough I will win.</p>  

      <p>I will persist. I will win.</p>

      <h2>The Scroll Marked IV</h2>
      <h3>I am nature's greatest miracle</h3>

      <p>I am nature’s greatest miracle.</p>  

      <p>Since the beginning of time never has
      there been another with my mind, my heart, my eyes, my ears, my hands, my
      hair, my mouth. None that came before, none that live today, and none that
      come tomorrow can walk and talk and move and think exactly like me. All
      men are my brothers yet I am different from each. I am a unique
      creature.</p>

      <p>I am nature’s greatest miracle.</p>  

      <p>Although I am of the animal kingdom,
      animal rewards alone will not satisfy me.  Within me burns a flame, which
      has been passed from generations uncounted, and its heat is a constant
      irritation to my spirit to become better than I am, and I will. I will fan
      this flame of dissatisfaction and proclaim my uniqueness to the world.</p>

      <p>None can duplicate my brush strokes, none can duplicate my chisel marks,
      none can duplicate my handwriting, none can produce my child, and, in
      truth, none has the ability to sell exactly as I. Henceforth, I will
      capitalize on this difference for it is an asset to be promoted to the
      fullest.</p>  

      <p>I am nature’s greatest miracle.</p>  

      <p>Vain attempts to imitate others
      no longer will I make. Instead I will place my uniqueness on display in
      the market place. I will proclaim it, yea, I will sell it. I will begin
      now to accent my differences; hide my similarities. So too will I apply
      this principle to the goods I sell. Salesman and goods, different from all
      others, and proud of the differences.</p>  

      <p>I am a unique creature of nature.</p>

      <p>I am rare, and there is value in all rarity; therefore, I am valuable. I
      am the end product of thousands of years of evolution; therefore, I am
      better equipped in both mind and body than all the emperors and wise men
      who preceded me. But my skills, my mind, my heart, and my body will
      stagnate, rot, and die lest I put them to good use. I have unlimited
      potential. Only a small portion of my brain do I employ; only a paltry
      amount of muscles do I flex. A hundredfold or more can I increase my
      accomplishments of yesterday and this I will do, beginning today.</p>

      <p>Nevermore will I be satisfied with yesterday’s accomplishments nor will I
      indulge, anymore, in self-praise for deeds which in reality are too small
      to even acknowledge.  I can accomplish far more than I have, and I will,
      for why should the miracle which produced me end with my birth? Why can I
      not extend that miracle to my deeds of today?</p>  

      <p>I am nature’s greatest miracle.</p>  

      <p>I am not on this earth by chance. I am here for a purpose and
      that purpose is to grow into a mountain, not to shrink to a grain of sand.
      Henceforth will I apply all my efforts to become the highest mountain of
      all and I will strain my potential until it cries for mercy.</p>  

      <p>I will
      increase my knowledge of mankind, myself, and the goods I sell, thus my
      sales will multiply. I will practice, and improve, and polish the words I
      utter to sell my goods, for this is the formulation on which I will build
      my career and never will I forget that many have attained great wealth and
      success with only one sales talk, delivered with excellence. Also will I
      seek constantly to improve my manners and graces, for they are the sugar
      to which all are attracted.</p>  

      <p>I am nature’s greatest miracle.</p>  

      <p>I will
      concentrate my energy on the challenge of the moment and my actions will
      help me forget all else. The problems of my home will be left in my home.
      I will think naught of my family when I am in the market place for this
      will cloud my thoughts. So too will the problems of the market place be
      left in the market place and I will think naught of my profession when I
      am in my home for this will dampen my love.</p>

      <p>There is no room in the
      market place for my family, nor is there room in my home for the market.
      Each I will divorce from the other and thus will I remain wedded to both.
      Separate must they remain or my career will die. This is the paradox of
      the ages.</p>  

      <p>I am nature’s greatest miracle.</p>  

      <p>I have been given eyes to see
      and a mind to think and now I know a great secret of life for I perceive,
      at last, that all my problems, discouragements, and heartaches are, in
      truth, great opportunities in disguise. I will no longer be fooled by the
      garments they wear for mine eyes are open. I will look beyond the cloth
      and I will not be deceived.</p>  

      <p>I am nature’s greatest miracle.</p>  

      <p>No beast, no
      plant, no wind, no rain, no rock, no lake had the same beginning as I, for
      I was conceived in love and brought forth with a purpose. In the past I
      have not considered this fact but it will henceforth shape and guide my
      life.</p>  

      <p>I am nature’s greatest miracle.</p>  

      <p>And nature knows not defeat.
      Eventually, she emerges victorious and so will I, and with each victory
      the next struggle becomes less difficult.</p>  

      <p>I will win, and I will become a great salesman, for I am unique.</p>  

      <p>I am nature’s greatest miracle.</p>

      <h3>I will live this day as if it is my last</h3>

      <p>I will live this day as if it is my last.</p>  

      <p>And what shall I do with this
      last precious day, which remains I my keeping? First, I will seal up its
      container of life so that not one drop spills itself upon the sand. I will
      waste not a moment mourning yesterday’s misfortunes, yesterday’s defeats,
      yesterday’s aches of the heart, for why should I throw good after bad?</p>

      <p>Can sand flow upward in the hourglass? Will the sun rise where it sets and
      set where it rises? Can I relive the errors of yesterday and right them?
      Can I call back yesterday’s wounds and make them whole? Can I become
      younger than yesterday?  Can I take back the evil that was spoken, the
      blows that were struck, the pain that was caused? No.  Yesterday is buried
      forever and I will think of it no more.</p>  

      <p>I will live this day as if it is my last.</p>  

      <p>And what then shall I do? Forgetting yesterday neither will I
      think of tomorrow. Why should I throw now after maybe? Can tomorrow’s sand
      flow through the glass before today’s? Will the sun rise twice this
      morning? Can I perform tomorrow’s deeds while standing in today’s path?
      Can I place tomorrow’s gold in today’s purse? Can tomorrow’s child be born
      today? Can tomorrow’s death cast its shadow backward and darken today’s
      joy? Should I concern myself over events, which I may never witness?
      Should I torment myself with problems that may never come to pass? No!
      Tomorrow lies buried with yesterday, and I will think of it no more.</p>  

      <p>I will live this day as if it is my last.</p>  

      <p>This day is all I have and these
      hours are now my eternity. I greet this sunrise with cries of joy as a
      prisoner who is reprieved from death. I lift mine arms with thanks for
      this priceless gift of a new day. So too, I will beat upon my heart with
      gratitude as I consider all who greeted yesterday’s sunrise who are no
      longer with the living today. I am indeed a fortunate man and today’s
      hours are but a bonus, undeserved.  Why have I been allowed to live this
      extra day when others, far better than I have departed? Is it that they
      have accomplished their purpose while mine is yet to be achieved? Is this
      another opportunity for me to become the man I know I can be? Is there a
      purpose in nature? Is this my day to excel?</p>  

      <p>I will live this day as if it is my last.</p>  

      <p>I have but one life and life is naught but a measurement of
      time. When I waste one I destroy the other. If I waste today I destroy the
      last page of my life.  Therefore, each hour of this day will I cherish for
      it can never return. It cannot be banked today to be withdrawn on the
      morrow, for who can trap the wind?  Each minute of this day will I grasp
      with both hands and fondle with love for its value is beyond price. What
      dying man can purchase another breath though he willingly give all his
      gold? What price dare I place on the hours ahead? I will make them
      priceless!</p>  

      <p>I will live this day as if it my last.</p>  

      <p>I will avoid with fury
      the killers of time. Procrastination I will destroy with action; doubt I
      will bury under faith; fear I will dismember with confidence. Where there
      are idle mouths I will listen not; where there are idle hands I will
      linger not; where there are idle bodies I will visit not. Henceforth I
      know that to court idleness is to steal food, clothing, and warmth from
      those I love. I am not a thief. I am a man of love and today is my last
      chance to prove my love and my greatness.</p>  

      <p>I will live this day as if it is my last.</p>  

      <p>The duties of today I shall fulfill today. Today I shall
      fondle my children while they are young; tomorrow they will be gone, and
      so will I. Today I shall embrace my woman with sweet kisses; tomorrow she
      will be gone, and so will I. Today I shall lift up a friend in need;
      tomorrow he will no longer cry for help, nor will I hear his cries.  Today
      I shall give myself in sacrifice and work; tomorrow I will have nothing to
      give, and there will be none to receive.</p>  

      <p>I will live this day as if it is my last.</p>  

      <p>And if it is my last, it will be my greatest monument. This day
      I will make the best day of my life. This day I will drink every minute to
      its full. I will savor its taste and give thanks. I will maketh every hour
      count and each minute. I will trade only for something of value. I will
      labor harder than ever before and push my muscles until they cry for
      relief, and then I will continue. I will make more calls than ever before.
      I will sell more goods than ever before. I will earn more gold than ever
      before. Each minute of today will be more fruitful than hours of
      yesterday. My last must be my best.</p>  

      <p>I will live this day as if it is my
      last. And if it is not, I shall fall to my knees and give thanks.</p>

      <h3>Today I will be master of my emotions</h3>

      <p>Today I will be master of my emotions.</p>  

      <p>The tides advance; the tides
      recede. Winter goes and summer comes. Summer wanes and the cold increases.
      The sun rises; the sun sets. The moon is full; the moon is black. The
      birds arrive; the birds depart. Flowers bloom; flowers fade. Seeds are
      sown; harvests are reaped. All nature is a circle of moods and I am a part
      of nature and so, like the tides, my moods will rise; my moods will
      fall.</p>
      
      <p>Today I will be master of my emotions.</p>  

      <p>It is one of nature’s tricks,
      little understood, that each day I awaken with moods that have changed
      from yesterday. Yesterday’s joy will become today’s sadness; yet today’s
      sadness will grow into tomorrow’s joy. Inside me is a wheel, constantly
      turning from sadness to joy, from exultation to depression, from happiness
      to melancholy. Like the flowers, today’s full bloom of joy will fade and
      wither into despondency, yet I will remember that as today’s dead flower
      carries the seed of tomorrow’s bloom so, too, does today’s sadness carry
      the seed of tomorrow’s joy.</p>  

      <p>Today I will be master of my emotions.</p>  

      <p>And
      how will I master these emotions so that each day will be productive? For
      unless my mood is right the day will be a failure. Trees and plants depend
      on the weather to flourish but I make my own weather, yea I transport it
      with me. If I bring rain and gloom and darkness and pessimism to my
      customers then they will react with rain and gloom and darkness and
      pessimism and they will purchase naught. If I bring joy and enthusiasm and
      brightness and laughter to my customers they will react with joy and
      enthusiasm and brightness and laughter and my weather will produce a
      harvest of sales and a granary of gold for me.</p>  

      <p>Today I will be master of emotions.</p>  

      <p>And how will I master my emotions so that every day is a happy
      day, and a productive one? I will learn this secret of the ages: Weak is
      he who permits his thoughts to control his actions; strong is he who
      forces his actions to control his thoughts. Each day, when I awake, I will
      follow this plan of battle before I am captured by the forces of sadness,
      self-pity and failure –</p>

      <ul>
        <li>If I feel depressed, I will sing.</li>  
        <li>If I feel sad, I will laugh.</li>
        <li>If I feel ill, I will double my labor.</li>
        <li>If I feel fear, I will plunge ahead.</li>
        <li>If I feel inferior, I will wear new garments.</li>
        <li>If I feel uncertain, I will raise my voice.</li>
        <li>If I feel poverty, I will think of wealth to come.</li>
        <li>If I feel incompetent, I will remember past success.</li>
        <li>If I feel insignificant, I will remember my goals.</li>  
      </ul>

      <p>Today I will be master of my emotions.</p>  

      <p>Henceforth, I will know
      that only those with inferior ability can always be at their best, and I
      am not inferior. There will always be days when I must constantly struggle
      against forces which would tear me down. Those such as despair and sadness
      are simple to recognize, but there are others, which approach with a smile
      and the hand of friendship, and they can also destroy me. Against them,
      too, I must never relinquish control –</p>

      <ul>
        <li>If I become overconfident, I will recall my failures.</li>
        <li>If I overindulge, I will think of past hungers.</li>
        <li>If I feel complacency, I will remember my competition.</li>
        <li>If I enjoy moments of greatness, I will remember moments of
        shame.</li>
        <li>If I feel all-powerful, I will try to stop the wind.</li>
        <li>If I attain great wealth, I will remember one unfed mouth.</li>
        <li>If I become overly proud, I will remember a moment of weakness.</li>
        <li>If I feel my skill is unmatched, I will look at the stars.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Today I will master my emotions.</p>  

      <p>And with this new
      knowledge, I will also understand and recognize the moods of he on whom I
      can call. I will make allowances for his anger and irritation of today for
      he knows not the secret of controlling his mind. I can withstand his
      arrows and insults for now I know that tomorrow he will change and be a
      joy to approach.</p>  

      <p>No longer will I judge a man on one meeting; no longer
      will I fail to call again tomorrow on he who meets me with hate today.
      This day he will not buy gold chariots for a penny, yet tomorrow he would
      exchange his home for a tree. My knowledge of this secret will be my key
      to great wealth.</p>  

      <p>Today I will be master of my emotions.</p>  

      <p>Henceforth I
      will recognize and identify the mystery of moods in all mankind, and in
      me. From this moment I am prepared to control whatever personality awakes
      in me each day. I will master my moods through positive action and when I
      master my moods, I will control my destiny.</p>  

      <p>Today I control my destiny,
      and my destiny is to become the greatest salesman in the world!</p>  

      <p>I will become master of myself. I will become great.</p>

      <h3>I will laugh at the world</h3>

      <p>I will laugh at the world.</p>  

      <p>No living creature can laugh except man. Trees
      may bleed when they are wounded, and beasts in the field will cry in pain
      and hunger, yet only I have the gift of laughter and it is mine to use
      whenever I choose. Henceforth I will cultivate the habit of laughter.</p>  

      <p>I will smile and my digestion will improve; I will chuckle and my burdens
      will be lightened; I will laugh and my life will be lengthened for this is
      the great secret of long life and now it is mine.</p>  

      <p>I will laugh at the world.</p>  

      <p>And most of all, I will laugh at myself for man is most comical
      when he takes himself too seriously. Never will I fall into this trap of
      the mind. For though I be nature’s greatest miracle, am I not still a mere
      grain tossed about by the winds of time? Do I truly know whence I came or
      whither I am bound? Will my concern for this day not seem foolish ten
      years hence? Why should I permit the petty happenings of today to disturb
      me? What can take place before this sun sets which will not seem
      insignificant in the river of centuries?</p>  

      <p>I will laugh at the world.</p>  

      <p>And
      how can I laugh when confronted with man or deed which offends me so as to
      bring forth my tears or my curses? Four words I will train myself to say
      until they become a habit so strong that immediately they will appear in
      my mind whenever good humor threatens to depart from me. These words,
      passed down from the ancients, will carry me through every adversity and
      maintain my life in balance.  These four words are: This too shall
      pass.</p>

      <p>I will laugh at the world.</p>  

      <p>For all the worldly things shall indeed pass.
      When I am heavy with heartache I shall console myself that this too shall
      pass; when I am puffed with success I shall warn myself that this too
      shall pass. When I am strangled in poverty I shall tell myself that this
      too shall pass; when I am burdened with wealth I shall tell myself that
      this too shall pass. Yea, verily, where is he who built the pyramid? Is he
      not buried within its stone? And will the pyramid, one day, not also be
      buried under sand? If all things shall pass why should I be of concern for
      today?</p>  

      <p>I will laugh at the world.</p>  

      <p>I will paint this day with laughter; I
      will frame this night in song. Never will I labor to be happy; rather will
      I remain too busy to be sad. I will enjoy today’s happiness today. It is
      not grain to be stored in a box. It is not wine to be saved in a jar. It
      cannot be saved for the morrow. It must be sown and reaped on the same day
      and this I will do, henceforth.</p>  

      <p>I will laugh at the world.</p>  

      <p>And with my
      laughter all things will be reduced to their proper size. I will laugh at
      my failures and they will vanish in clouds of new dreams; I will laugh at
      my successes and they will shrink to their true value. I will laugh at
      evil and it will die untasted; I will laugh at goodness and it will thrive
      and bound. Each day will be triumphant only when my smiles bring forth
      smiles from others and this I do in selfishness, for those on whom I frown
      are those who purchase not my goods.</p>  

      <p>I will laugh at the world.</p>

      <p>Henceforth will I shed only tears of sweat, for those of sadness or
      remorse or frustration are of no value in the market place whilst each
      smile can be exchanged for gold and each kind word, spoken from my heart,
      can build a castle.</p>  

      <p>Never will I allow myself to become so important, so
      wise, so dignified, so powerful, that I forget how to laugh at myself and
      my world. In this matter I will always remain as a child, for only as a
      child am I given the ability to look up to others; and so long as I look
      up to another I will never grow too long for my cot.</p>  

      <p>I will laugh at the world.</p>  

      <p>And so long as I can laugh never will I be poor. This then, is one
      of nature’s greatest gifts, and I will waste it no more. Only with
      laughter and happiness can I truly become a success. Only with laughter
      and happiness can I enjoy the fruits of my labor. Were it not so, far
      better would it be to fail, for happiness is the wine that sharpens the
      taste of the meal. To enjoy success I must have happiness, and laughter
      will be the maiden who serves me.</p>  

      <p>I will be happy. I will be successful. I will be the greatest salesman 
      the world has ever known.</p>

      <h3>Today I will multiply my value a hundredfold</h3>

      <p>Today I will multiply my value a hundredfold.</p>  

      <p>A mulberry leaf touched with the genius of man becomes silk.</p>  

      <p>A field of clay touched with the genius of man becomes a castle.</p>  

      <p>A cypress tree touched with the genius of man becomes a shrine.</p>  

      <p>A cut of sheep’s hair touched with the genius of man becomes raiment 
      for a king.</p>  

      <p>If it is possible for leaves and clay and
      wood and hair to have their value multiplied a hundred, yea a thousand
      fold by man, cannot I do the same with the clay which bears my name?</p>
      
      <p>Today I will multiply my value a hundredfold.</p>  

      <p>I am liken to a grain of
      wheat which faces one of three futures. The wheat can be placed in a sack
      and dumped in a stall until it is fed to swine. Or it can be ground to
      flour and made into bread. Or it can be placed in the earth and allowed to
      grow until its golden head divides and produces a thousand grains from the
      one.</p>  

      <p>I am liken to a grain of wheat with one difference. The wheat cannot
      choose whether it be fed to swine, ground for bread, or planted to
      multiply. I have a choice and I will not let my life be fed to swine and
      despair to be broken open and devoured by the will of others.</p>  

      <p>Today I will multiply my value a hundredfold.</p>  

      <p>To grow and multiply it is
      necessary to plant the wheat grain in the darkness of the earth and my
      failures, my despairs, my ignorance, and my inabilities are the darkness
      in which I have been planted in order to ripen. Now, like the wheat grain
      which will sprout and blossom only if it is nurtured with rain and sun and
      warm winds, I too must nurture my body and mind to fulfill my dreams. But
      to grow to full stature the wheat must wait on the whims of nature. I need
      not wait for I have the power to choose my own destiny.</p>  

      <p>Today I will multiply my value a hundredfold.</p>  

      <p>And how will I accomplish this? First I
      will set goals for the day, the week, the month, the year, and my life.
      Just as the rain must fall before the wheat will crack its shield and
      sprout, so must I have objectives before my life will crystallize. In
      setting my goals I will consider my best performance of the past and
      multiply it a hundredfold. This will be the standard by which I will live
      in the future. Never will I be of concern that my goals are too high for
      is it not better to aim my spear at the moon and strike only an eagle than
      to aim my spear at the eagle and strike only a rock?</p>  

      <p>Today I will multiply my value a hundredfold.</p>  

      <p>The height of my goals will not hold me
      in awe though I may stumble often before they are reached. If I stumble I
      will rise and my falls will not concern me for all men must stumble often
      to reach the hearth. Only a worm is free from the worry of stumbling. I am
      not a worm. I am not an onion plant. I am not a sheep. I am a man.  Let
      others build a cave with their clay. I will build a castle with mine.</p>

      <p>Today I will multiply my value a hundredfold.</p>  

      <p>And just as the sun must
      warm the earth to bring forth the seedling of wheat so, too, will the
      words on these scrolls warm my life and turn my dreams into reality. Today
      I will surpass every action which I performed yesterday. I will climb
      today’s mountain to the utmost of my ability yet tomorrow I will climb
      higher than today and the next will be higher than tomorrow. To surpass
      the deeds of others is unimportant; to surpass my own deeds is all.</p>  

      <p>Today I will multiply my value a hundredfold.</p>  

      <p>And just as the warm wind guides
      the wheat to maturity, the same winds will carry my voice to those who
      will listen and my words will announce my goals. Once spoken I dare not
      recall them lest I lose face. I will be as my own prophet and though all
      may laugh at my utterances they will hear my plans, they will know my
      dreams; and thus their will be no escape for me until my words become
      accomplished deeds.</p>  

      <p>Today I will multiply my value a hundredfold.</p>  

      <p>I will commit not the terrible crime of aiming too low.</p>  

      <p>I will do the work that a failure will not do.</p>  

      <p>I will always let my reach exceed my grasp.</p>  

      <p>I will never be content with my performance in the market.</p>  

      <p>I will always raise my goals as soon as they are attained.</p>  

      <p>I will always strive to make the next hour better than this one.</p>  

      <p>I will always announce my goals to the world.</p>  

      <p>Yet, never will I proclaim my accomplishments. Let the world,
      instead, approach me with praise and may I have the wisdom to receive it
      in humility.</p>  

      <p>Today I will multiply my value a hundredfold.</p>  

      <p>One grain of
      wheat when multiplied a hundredfold will produce a hundred stalks.
      Multiply these a hundredfold, ten times, and they will feed all the cities
      of the earth.  Am I not more than a grain of wheat?</p>  

      <p>Today I will multiply my value a hundredfold.</p>  

      <p>And when it is done I will do it again, and
      again, and there will be astonishment and wonder at my greatness as the
      words of these scrolls are fulfilled in me.</p>

      so much as a penny or produced a single word of acclamation. Action,
      alone, is the tinder which ignites the map, the parchment, this scroll, my
      dreams, my plans, my goals, into a living force. Action is the food and
      drink which will nourish my success.</p>  

      <p>I will action now.</p>  

      <p>My
      procrastination which has held me back was born of fear and now I
      recognize this secret mined from the depths of courageous hearts. Now I
      know that to conquer fear I must always act without hesitation and the
      flutters in my heart will vanish.  Now I know that action reduces the lion
      of terror to an ant of equanimity.</p>  

      <p>I will act now.</p>  

      <p>Henceforth, I will
      remember the lesson of the firefly who gives off its light only when it is
      on the wing, only when it is in action. I will become a firefly and even
      in the day my glow will be seen in spite of the sun. Let others be as
      butterflies who preen their wings yet depend on the charity of a flower
      for life. I will be as the firefly and my light will brighten the
      world.</p>

      <p>I will act now.</p>  

      <p>I will not avoid the tasks of today and charge them to
      tomorrow for I know that tomorrow never comes. Let me act now even though
      my actions may not bring happiness or success for it is better to act and
      fail than not to act and flounder.  Happiness, in truth, may not be the
      fruit plucked by my action yet without action all fruit will die on the
      vine.</p>  

      <p>I will act now.</p>  

      <p>I will act now. I will act now. I will act now.
      Henceforth, I will repeat these words again and again and again, each
      hour, each day, every day, until the words become as much a habit as my
      breathing and the actions which follow become as instinctive as the
      blinking of my eyelids. With these words I can condition my mind to
      perform every act necessary for my success. With these words I can
      condition my mind to meet every challenge which the failure avoids.</p>  

      <p>I will act now.</p>  

      <p>I will repeat these words again and again and again. When I
      awake I will say them and leap from my cot while the failure sleeps yet
      another hour.</p>  

      <p>I will act now.</p>  

      <p>When I enter the market place I will say
      them and immediately confront my first prospect while the failure ponders
      yet his possibility of rebuff.</p>  

      <p>I will act now.</p>  

      <p>When I face a closed door
      I will say them and knock while the failure waits outside with fear and
      trepidation.</p>  

      <p>I will act now.</p>  

      <p>When I face temptation I will say them and
      immediately act to remove myself from evil.</p>  

      <p>I will act now.</p>  

      <p>When I am
      tempted to quit and begin again tomorrow I will say them and immediately
      act to consummate another sale.</p>  

      <p>I will act now.</p>  

      <p>Only action determines
      my value in the market place and to multiply my value I will multiply my
      actions. I will walk where the failure fears to walk. I will work when the
      failure seeks rest. I will talk when the failure remains silent. I will
      call on ten who can buy my goods while the failure makes grand plans to
      call on one. I will say it is done before the failure says it is too
      late.</p>
      
      <p>I will act now.</p>  

      <p>For now is all I have. Tomorrow is the day reserved for
      the labor of the lazy. I am not lazy. Tomorrow is the day when the evil
      become good. I am not evil. Tomorrow is the day when the weak become
      strong. I am not weak. Tomorrow is the day when the failure will succeed.
      I am not a failure.</p>  

      <p>I will act now.</p>  

      <p>When the lion is hungry he eats. When the eagle has thirst he drinks. 
      Lest they act, both will perish.</p>  

      <p>I hunger for success. I thirst for happiness and peace of mind. Lest I act I
      will perish in a life of failure, misery, and sleepless nights. I will
      command, and I will obey mine own command.</p>  

      <p>I will act now.</p>  

      <p>Success will
      not wait. If I delay she will become betrothed to another and lost to me
      forever. This is the time. This is the place. I am the man.</p>  

      <p>I will act now.</p>

      <h2>The Scroll Marked X</h2>
      <h3>I will pray for guidance</h3>

      <p>Who is of so little faith that in a moment of great disaster or heartbreak
      has not called to his God? Who has not cried out when confronted with
      danger, death, or mystery beyond his norm experience or comprehension?
      From where has this deep instinct come which escapes from the mouth of all
      living creatures in moments of peril?</p>  

      <p>Move your hand in haste before
      another’s eyes and his eyelids will blink. Tap another on his knee and his
      leg will jump. Confront another with dark horror and his mouth will say,
      "My God" from the same deep impulse.</p>  

      <p>My life need not be filled with
      religion in order for me to recognize this greatest mystery of nature. All
      creatures that walk the earth, including man, possess the instinct to cry
      for help. Why do we possess this instinct, this gift?</p>  

      <p>Are not our cries a
      form of prayer? Is it not incomprehensible to a world governed by nature’s
      laws to give a lamb, or a mule, or a bird, or man the instinct to cry for
      help lest some great mind has also provided that the cry should be heard
      by some superior power having the ability to hear and to answer our cry?
      Henceforth I will pray, but my cries for help will only be cries for
      guidance.</p>  

      <p>Never will I pray for the material things of the world. I am
      not calling to a servant to bring me good. I am not ordering an innkeeper
      to provide me with room. Never will I seek delivery of gold, love, good
      health, petty victories, fame, success, or happiness.  Only for guidance
      will I pray, that I may be shown the way to acquire these things, and my
      prayer will always be answered.</p>  

      <p>The guidance I seek may come, or the
      guidance I seek may not come, but are not both of these an answer? If a
      child seeks bread from his father and it is not forthcoming has not the
      father answered?</p>  

      <p>I will pray for guidance, and I will pray as a salesman,
      in this manner – 

      <ul>
        <li>Oh creator of all things, help me. For this day I go out
        into the world naked and alone, and without your hand to guide me I will
        wander far from the path which leads to success and happiness.</li> 

        <li>I ask not for gold or garments or even opportunities equal to my
        ability; instead, guide me so that I may acquire ability equal to my
        opportunities.</li>

        <li>You have taught the lion and the eagle how to hunt and
        prosper with teeth and claw.  Teach me how to hunt with words and prosper
        with love so that I may be a lion among men and an eagle in the market
        place.</li>

        <li>Help me to remain humble through obstacles and failures; yet
        hide not from mine eyes the prize that will come with victory.</li>

        <li>Assign me tasks to which others have failed; yet guide me to pluck
        the seeds of success from their failures. Confront me with fears that
        will temper my spirit; yet endow me with courage to laugh at my
        misgivings.</li>

        <li>Spare me sufficient days to reach my goals; yet help me
        to live this day as though it be my last.<li>

        <li>Guide me in my words that they may bear fruit; yet silence me from 
        gossip that none be maligned.</li>

        <li>Discipline me in the habit of trying and trying again; yet show me the
        way to make use of the law of averages. Favor me with alertness to
        recognize opportunity; yet endow me with patience which will concentrate
        my strength.</li>

        <li>Bathe me in good habits that the bad ones may drown; yet
        grant me compassion for weakness in others. Suffer me to know that all
        things shall pass; yet help me to count my blessings today.</li>

        <li>Expose me
        to hate so it not be a stranger; yet fill my cup with love to turn
        strangers into friends.</li>

        <li>But all these things be only if thy will. I
        am a small and a lonely grape clutching the vine yet though hast made me
        different from all others. Verily, there must be a special place for
        me. Help me. Show me the way.</li> 

        <li>Let me become all you planned for me
        when my seed was planted and selected by you to sprout in the vineyard
        of the world.</li>  
      
      </ul>

      <p>Help this humble salesman.</p>  

      <p>Guide me, God.</p>
